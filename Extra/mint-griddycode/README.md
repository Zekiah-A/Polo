Syntax hilighting rules for the griddycode text editor (yes this is a massive joke).
Reference docs can be found at: https://github.com/face-hh/griddycode/?tab=readme-ov-file#docs

### Developing:
It is recommended you follow the guides provided in the griddycode README for more info on
how to maintain this plugin. Make use of a symlink from the AppData plugin install path
to the mt.lua file for easier development.
