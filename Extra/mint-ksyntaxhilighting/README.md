# mint-ksyntaxhilighting
Syntax hilighting rules for KDE-Frameworks based text editors.
Reference docs can be found at: https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kate/katepart/highlight.html

### Developing:
It is recommended you make use of a symlink from the custom theme install path to the mint.xml file
in this directory to speed up testing. The command `F7 + reload-hilighting` can be used from within
text editors such as Kate, Kwrite or KDebevelop to quickly preview new changes in the current selected
syntax hilighting theme.
